# OpenClaw Runtime Stabilizer

Public engineering artifact and reliability case study for OpenClaw runtime/session-store incidents.

This repository documents a real stabilization workflow for a local AI agent runtime after session-store inconsistency, dashboard session collisions, orphaned session entries, and runtime/config drift. The public edition focuses on safe diagnosis, reproducible documentation, evidence redaction, rollback discipline, and operational verification.

## Why this matters

Local AI agent runtimes are stateful systems. When sessions, registries, dashboards, compaction artifacts, and runtime bundles drift out of sync, the result can look like data loss even when transcripts still exist on disk. A safe repair workflow must preserve data first, verify state before modifying it, and avoid destructive resets.

## Scope

This public edition includes:

- incident analysis and executive summary
- troubleshooting matrix for similar symptoms
- architecture notes for the stabilization approach
- rollback and verification policy
- redaction policy for public release
- sanitized evidence summary
- examples for safe environment documentation
- placeholders for future dry-run tools

This repository intentionally does **not** publish private transcripts, raw local logs, machine-specific paths, hostnames, tokens, or one-click destructive repair operations.

## Current release status

`v0.1.0` is a public documentation edition. It is designed for review, learning, incident comparison, and safe operational planning. Future releases may add read-only verification tooling.

## Safety position

The project is defensive and reliability-focused. It is not a bypass toolkit, exploit project, or destructive patch collection. The default rule is: inspect first, preserve data, verify hashes, and never delete transcripts as a first response.
